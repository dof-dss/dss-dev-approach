## Developing new services

### Building to the enterprise architecture blueprint

All new services must follow the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Blueprint][1]. This means that we build services which deliver the best possible experience to our customers while maximising the use of currently available technologies in the most cost effective way.

### Agile approach

DSS has adopted an [agile approach][8] to developing digital services for its customers. This is significantly different from previous approaches e.g. Waterfall and it presents a number of challenges. However, the benefits of this approach can be substantial provided all parties clearly understand the role they play.

### Project management

Although DSS has adopted an agile approach to service delivery this does not mean that traditional best practice in [project management][5] should be abandoned. In fact, project management has a vital role to play ensuring that all the other elements of a business change project are carefully planned and executed as part of the delivery of any new digital service.

### Developer guidance

DSS has produced guidance for developers designing and building digital services for the NICS:
