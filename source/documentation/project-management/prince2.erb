## Project management approach

Project Management is a tried and tested approach to delivering successful business outcomes. Project management has been widely used in Government for quite some time now, typically using the PRINCE2 structured method. A more detailed description of project management can be found on the [Department of Finance website][1].

PRINCE2 provides projects with:

- a controlled and organised start, middle and end
- regular reviews of progress against the plan and the business case
- flexible decision points
- management control of any deviations from the plan
- the involvement of management and stakeholders at the right time during the project
- good communication channels between the project management team and the rest of the organisation
- agreement on the required quality at the outset and continuous monitoring

## Risk management

An extremely import element of PRINCE2 concerns the management of risk; project management must control and contain risks if a project is to stand a chance of being successful.
