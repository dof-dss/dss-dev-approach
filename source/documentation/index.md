# DSS Development Approach

The DSS Development Approach documents the specific technology, tools and processes that Digital Shared Services teams use to build and operate services.

It is not intended as guidance for anyone working outside DSS.

This document forms part of a suite of documents which can be used by DSS and its delivery partners when developing digital services for its customers (internal and external).

[NICS Enterprise Architecture][1]

This document describes the principles, constraints, capabilities and initiatives that are needed to deliver the next generation of NICS digital services.

[DSS Developer Docs][2]

This document describes the processes, technologies, tools and standards to be followed by development teams when building digital services.

[DSS Security Operating Procedures][3]

This document describes the procedures and processes to be followed to ensure that our applications are secure and that our customers' data is protected.

[DSS Application Support][4]

This document describes how we support applications once they have gone into live service (production).

## Ways of working

### Planning and prioritisation

DSS works on the highest priorities while supporting live services and adjusting its plans when priorities change. DSS uses an Agile approach to plan and carry out its work in a quarterly planning cycle [develop and add link].

## Developing new services

### Building to the enterprise architecture blueprint

All new services must follow the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Blueprint][1]. This means that we build services which deliver the best possible experience to our customers while maximising the use of currently available technologies in the most cost effective way.

### Agile approach

DSS has adopted an [agile approach][8] to developing digital services for its customers. This is significantly different from previous approaches e.g. Waterfall and it presents a number of challenges. However, the benefits of this approach can be substantial provided all parties clearly understand the role they play.

### Project management

Although DSS has adopted an agile approach to service delivery this does not mean that traditional best practice in [project management][5] should be abandoned. In fact, project management has a vital role to play ensuring that all the other elements of a business change project are carefully planned and executed as part of the delivery of any new digital service.

### Developer guidance

DSS has produced guidance for developers designing and building digital services for the NICS:
