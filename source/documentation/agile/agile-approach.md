## Terminology

DSS has adopted an Agile approach to developing digital services for its customers. It is quite a departure from previous approaches and this is borne out in the [Agile Manifesto][2]. It requires a high level of collaboration and personal interaction. The success of this approach depends very heavily on developing meaningful and productive relationships between all those involved.

If you are unfamiliar with the terms used in Agile projects then the Association for Project Management website provides a useful [Agile project management glossary][3].

## How we implement Agile principles

DSS teams use the [Scrum][7] framework to manage their work. Scrum uses a set of artifacts, practices and roles to achieve this.

## Engagement with DSS

Once a customer has approached DSS with an idea, the Customer Relationship Management function will ask the customer to complete a [Project Brief]().

The project brief will seek the following assurances from the customer before any work is undertaken:

- an approved business case is in place
- budget cover is in place to facilitate payment to DSS
- a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) has been conducted and approved
- a Business Impact Assessment (BIA) has been conducted and approved

## Use of project and team charters

## Roles and responsibilities

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is the person who envisions the final product and sees it through to completion. The role includes the following activities:

- describing features
- collaborating and communicating with the delivery team
- accepting or rejecting work results
- steering the project by tracking and forecasting its progress

In an Agile approach requirements are continuously evolving. It is therefore essential that the Product Owner makes a personal commitment to be available at short notice to answer questions for the delivery team throughout the process. The Product Owner should also be available to test and use the system in order to provide timely feedback. If the Product Owner is unavailable then the Product Owner must designate another member of the team to fulfil the role. It is crucial that information flow between the delivery team and customer is maintained and it is up to the Product Owner to ensure this happens.

A Product Owner must:

- provide a vision for the product and communicate this to the team
- communicate the business benefits of the entire product and each feature
- ensure the team builds the right product in a way that will deliver there business benefits
- define the scope of the project aligning this with budget and time constraints
- create the product backlog
- continuously maintain and prioritise the backlog
- define releases and sprint goals
- continuously answer questions to add detail to requirements
- accept/reject developed user stories
- communicate within the wider organisation

Product Owners and their designated deputies **must** attend the following CAL facilitated workshop based training:

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

### Information Asset Owner

Information Asset Owners are senior officials whose business area use one or more information assets (both information that is owned by Government and that which is entrusted to it).

An information asset can be defined as an identifiable collection of data stored in any manner, at any location and recognised as having value for the purposes of performing its business functions and activities. Further guidance on information assets can be found in section 1.5 of the [IAO handbook][6].

The key responsibilities of an Information Asset Owner are to:

- know what information the asset holds and what information is transferred in or out of it
- know who has access and why and ensure use of the asset is monitored
- understand the risks to the asset and provide assurance to the SIRO
- ensure the asset is full used for the public good including responding to access requests
- lead and foster a culture that values, protects and uses information for the public good

Section 6 of the [IAO handbook][6] provides detailed guidance on the role of the IAO.

### Senior Responsible Owner

The [Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)][1] role is well defined in the public sector. The SRO is ultimately responsible for the successful delivery of the project.
