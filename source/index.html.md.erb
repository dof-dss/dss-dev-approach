# DSS Development Approach

<%= partial 'documentation/overview' %>

## Ways of working

### Planning and prioritisation

Planning and prioritisation happens at a number of levels within an organisation. The table below maps planning horizons, architecture levels and means of Agile requirement.

| Enterprise level | Planning horizon | Architecture level (TOGAF) | Requirement level |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Business and IT strategy | Vision | Enterprise strategic architecture | Theme |
| Project portfolio | Road map | Segment architecture | Epic |
| Programme | Release | Capability architecture | Feature |
| Project | Milestone |  | User story |

DSS works on the highest priorities while supporting live services and adjusting its plans when priorities change. DSS uses an Agile approach to plan and carry out its work in a quarterly planning cycle.

### How we plan for the next quarter

DSS develops roadmaps for the year ahead based on existing services and requests for new services and delivers in 3 month cycles. A team's work for a quarter is called a *mission*.

For each quarter the planning process defines:

- mission priorities
- which missions are carried out
- forecast benefits
- dependencies
- team sizes and who works where

DSS teams work in an [agile way](#agile-approach) releasing usable software on a frequent basis. Missions finish at the end of each quarter and there's no assumption a piece of work will necessarily continue into the next quarter. For example, a ministerial directive or legislative requirement may alter the prioritisation of missions during a planning cycle.

A mission will typically consist of 6 two week sprints. Therefore, it is extremely important that usable software, that delivers real business value, is released throughout the mission and at the very latest by the end of the mission. This will force product owners to think about how their service can be delivered in a more incremental way.

### Product roadmaps

A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of a product over time. It communicates what we are building and why. A product roadmap will include a number of the following:

- new features
- business as usual activities to support a service
- work to fix defects
- explorative work (discoveries)
- discovery or alpha work
- resolving technical debt (legacy issues)

The GOV.UK Service Manual provides some very useful guidance on [developing a roadmap][1].

### How we prioritise

DSS has a limited pool of resources and therefore prioritisation is all about making the best use of these scarce resources. The quarterly planning process defines what teams work on during a quarter, including the size and makeup of the teams doing the work.

When work can't be accomodated by our internal resources we can avail of contracts we have in place to effectively outsource specific work packages. However, these contracts have a financial ceiling and so priorisation will always come into play.

Prioritisation will take place based on service backlogs and the highest priority items in a number of services will be selected for inclusion in a mission.

*image of service prioritisation goes here!*

Inputs into prioritisation include:

- business as usual
- availability of skilled resources
- departmental or programme commitments

Quarterly planning takes into account:

- new approved work
- risk management
- dependencies
- DSS strategies
- architecture roadmaps

The DSS Leadership Team signs off each quarter's scope expressed as a list of prioritised missions.

Potential missions can come from many sources, for example Digital Transformation Service, Account Management or from senior officials.
