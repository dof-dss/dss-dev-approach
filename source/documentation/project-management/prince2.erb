## Project management approach

Project Management is a tried and tested approach to delivering successful business outcomes. Project management has been widely used in Government for quite some time now, typically using the PRINCE2 structured method. For more detailed description see the [Department of Finance Project Managment Guidance][1].

PRINCE2 provides projects with:

- a controlled and organised start, middle and end
- regular reviews of progress against the plan and the business case
- flexible decision points
- management control of any deviations from the plan
- the involvement of management and stakeholders at the right time during the project
- good communication channels between the project management team and the rest of the organisation
- agreement on the required quality at the outset and continuous monitoring

## Risk management

An extremely import element of PRINCE2 concerns the management of risk; project management must control and contain risks if a project is to stand a chance of being successful.

The following risks are based on the common causes of failure associated with IT projects compiled by the National Audit Office. When a risk register is being created these should be considered for inclusion.

| Ref. | Description | Prob. | Impact | Score |
| ----: | ----------- | -----: | ------: | -----: |
| 1  |  A lack of skill and proven approach to project management and risk/issue management may result in project failure or reduced project benefits |  3 |  3 |  9 |
| 2   | A lack of stakeholder engagement will result in the requirements for the proposed solution being incomplete or changing and the project will overrun with increased cost  | 3  | 3  | 9  |
| 3   | Lack of user involvement will result in poorly defined requirements, ineffective testing and ultimately an end product that is not fit for purpose  | 3  | 3  | 9  |
| 4   | Unrealistic customer expectations and/or unreasonable timescales may result in breakdown of the project  | 3  | 3  | 9  |
